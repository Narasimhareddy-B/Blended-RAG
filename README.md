### Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach to infuse a private knowledge base of documents with Large Language Models (LLM) to build Generative Q\&A (Question-Answering) systems. However, RAG accuracy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of documents scales up; with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose the method of leveraging semantic search techniques such as Dense Vector indexes and Sparse Encoder Based indexes, blended with hybrid query strategies. Our study achieve better retrieval results and sets new benchmarks for IR (Information Retrieval) datasets like NQ and TREC-COVID datasets. We further extend such a 'Blended Retriever' to RAG system, to demonstrate far superior results on Generative Q\&A datasets like SQUAD, even surpassing fine-tuning performance.
